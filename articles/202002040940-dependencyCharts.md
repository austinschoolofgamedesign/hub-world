# Dependency Charts

## Ron Gilbert Style Charts

## Mark Brown Style Charts

Mark Brown's charts are cool in that the structure of the chart itself conveys more information than a more flexible chart can.
For example, in Ron Gilbert's charts above, the fluid nature of where elements are placed makes it difficult to quickly scan the chart to gain meaningful information.
It acts more as documentation than it does as a tool to be read.

Mark's charts, in contrast, are built with a specific goal in mind, and that limitation allows for quick parsing.
They originally started as a graph to map out the key/lock dependencies in the *Zelda* games.
As such, they are hevily influenced by how those games tend to use keys and locks.

### Chart Elements

A **lock** can be more generally thought of as a designer imposed obstacle.
Locked doors obviously fit into this category, but less obviously includes switches that con only be activated by being shot with an arrow.
Or a ledge that can only be scaled with a new power-up.

A **key** is the thing that allows you, as the player, to bypass a particular **lock**.
To use those same examples, a small key would open a typical door.
A bow and arrow would be a 'key item' that allows you to shoot the lock with the required arrow.
And the ledge could be scaled via a double-jump powerup.

Because everything is simplified into a set of **locks** and **keys**, the chart can be optimized to focus on surfacing the relationship between them.
And herein lies the brilliance of Mark's charts.
