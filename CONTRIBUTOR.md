## Big Freaking Welcome

We're *so* glad you're here!
The *Austin School of Game Design* is a large ongoing project that is trying to do the work of many full-time employees, without the employees.
For that to be possible, we thrive off of contributions from awesome peoplel like you.

If this is your first time contributing to an open source project, then read on!
We have detailed instructions so you don't get overwhelmed by it all.
There's some technical jargon you'll need to pick up on, but it's nothing too bad once it's all explained.

If you're a hardened open source veteran, then you'll find that contributing to a non-software open source project is a tad different than contributing to its software counterparts.
It's not *dramatically* different, but the purposes and organization are more fluid.
Expect more discussion and soft opinions here.

## Code of Conduct

Before we get to the fun stuff, we need to set some ground rules.
We're all part of a larger community here, and we all want the same end goal - to build the best and most accessible game design school in the world.
However, sometimes we have different opinions about the steps to get there, and tensions can rise up.
So we've put together some basic ground rules to make sure that everyone can work together amicably.

Before going further, take some time to read through the [**Code of Conduct**](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Let's all do our part to make sure this place is an awesome place to share our thoughts and feels about games.

## How to Use GitHub

There's a lot of jargon around GitHub that will take some getting used to if you're not familiar.

> ### If you know how to use GitHub already:
>
> *ASGD* uses [**Issues**](https://github.com/austinschoolofgamedesign/hub-world/issues) as a place for permanent discussion as well as suggestions and typo fixes.
> Think of Issues as the *ASGD* forums, but with a bent toward making progress rather than being a discussion archive.
>
> And [**Pull Requests**](https://github.com/austinschoolofgamedesign/hub-world/pulls) are where we keep all new content.
> Drafts of new content will be reviewed there.



### Start conversations by creating an 'Issue'

### Submit drafts for review by opening a 'Pull Request'

## Formatting and Styling

Everything here is written in plain-text using Markdown for formatting.
This may take a bit of getting used to at first, but we've got you covered.
It's not complete yet, but soon we'll have a super useful tutorial/explanation.

If you're a software developer, there are some fantastic Markdown tools built into your IDE.
If you're not comfortable using the development tools of a software developer, I recommend checking out free Markdown tools like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/).
