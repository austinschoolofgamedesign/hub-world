## A Big Welcome

We're *so* glad you're here!
The *Austin School of Game Design* is a large ongoing project that is trying to do the work of many full-time employees, without the employees.
For that to be possible, we thrive off of contributions from awesome peoplel like you.

If this is your first time contributing to an open source project, then read on!
We have detailed instructions so you don't get overwhelmed by it all.
There's some technical jargon you'll need to pick up on, but it's nothing too bad once it's all explained.

If you're a hardened open source veteran, then you'll find that contributing to a non-software open source project is a tad different than contributing to its software counterparts.
It's not *dramatically* different, but the purposes and organization are more fluid.
Expect more discussion and soft opinions here.

## Code of Conduct

Before we get to the fun stuff, we need to set some ground rules.
We're all part of a larger community here, and we all want the same end goal - to build the best and most accessible game design school in the world.
However, sometimes we have different opinions about the steps to get there, and tensions can rise up.
So we've put together some basic ground rules to make sure that everyone can work together amicably.

Before going further, take some time to read through the [**Code of Conduct**](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Let's all do our part to make sure this place is an awesome place to share our thoughts and feels about games.

## Join the Conversation

Now that the ground rules are out of the way, it's time for us to get to know each other.
We have two official places set up to talk. Both places are great for getting to know other game design nerds.

1. The first is in the [Issues](https://github.com/austinschoolofgamedesign/hub-world/issues)  section of GitHub.
When you have an idea of something you want to contribute, open up an Issue and start a conversation.
1. For less formal conversations, jump into the [*Austin School of Game Design* Discord channel](https://discord.gg/mbPRNRG).
We're always happy to see new faces and learn what brought you our way.

## How to Use GitHub

There's a lot of jargon around GitHub that will take some getting used to if you're not familiar with it.
In this section we'll go over some of the common terms and how we use them at *ASGD*.

> ### If you already know how to use GitHub (TL;DR):
>
> *ASGD* uses [**Issues**](https://github.com/austinschoolofgamedesign/hub-world/issues) as the place for permanent discussion, as well as for making suggestions for updates, requests and typo fixes.
> Think of Issues as the *ASGD* forums with a focus on making content rather than being a discussion archive.
>
> [**Pull Requests**](https://github.com/austinschoolofgamedesign/hub-world/pulls) are where we keep all new content.
> As soon as you start working on something new, make a new branch and open a 'Draft Pull Request'

## Formatting and Styling

Everything here is written in plain-text using Markdown for formatting.
This may take a bit of getting used to at first, but we've got you covered.

If you're a software developer, there are some fantastic Markdown tools built into your IDE.
If you're not comfortable using the dev tools, I recommend checking out free Markdown editors like [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/).

### Brief overview of Markdown

Modern word processors like Microsoft Word or Libre Office have a ton of options for styling text with different fonts, colors and layouts.
For our purposes at *ASGD*, most of those features only cause problems.
