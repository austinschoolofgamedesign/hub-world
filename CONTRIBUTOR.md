## Formatting and Styling

Everything here is written in plain-text using Markdown for formatting.
This may take a bit of getting used to at first, but we've got you covered.
Check out our super useful tutorial/explanation here.

---

1.  **Welcome contributors to the project**: Admit that you
                  are eager for contributions and so happy they found themselves here.

2.  **Table of Contents**:
                    If your CONTRIBUTING.md file is long, you might consider including a table
                    of contents with links to different headings in your document. In github,
                    each heading is given a URL by default, so you can link to that URL in the
                    appropriate section of the Table of Contents for each heading. Do this in
                    Markdown by wrapping the heading in [ ] and following with a parenthetical
                    that includes the URL or header after # like `[Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)`.

3.  **Short Links to Important Resources**:  
      **docs**: handbook / roadmap (you'll learn more about this in
                  the roadmapping session)  
     **bugs**: issue tracker / bug report tool  
     **comms**: forum link, developer list, IRC/email  
4.  **Testing**: how to test the project, where the tests are
                  located in your directories.

5.  **Environment details**: how to set up your development
                  environment.  This might exist in the README.md depending on the project.
                  If so, include a link.

6.  **How to submit changes**: Pull Request protocol etc. You
                  might also include what response they'll get back from the team on submission,
                  or any caveats about the speed of response.

7.  **How to report a bug**: Bugs are problems in code, in the
                  functionality of an application or in its UI design; you can submit them
                  through "bug trackers" and most projects invite you to do so, so that
                  they may "debug" with more efficiency and the input of a contributor.
                  Take a look at [              Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs) for how to teach people to report bugs to your project.

8.  **Templates**: in this section of your file, you might also
                  want to link to a bug report "template" like this one
                  [here](https://gist.github.com/auremoser/72803ba969d0e61ff070)
                  which contributors can copy and add context to; this will keep your bugs
                  tidy and relevant.

9.  **First bugs for Contributors**: Sometimes it is helpful to
                  provide some guidelines for the types of bugs contributors should tackle
                  (should they want to fix the bugs and not just submit them), see Atom's
                  example section [here](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#styleguides).

10.  **How to request an "enhancement"** - enhancements are features that
                  you might like to suggest to a project, but aren't necessarily bugs/problems with
                  the existing code; there is a "label" for enhancments in Github's Issues
                  (where you report bugs), so you can tag issues as "enhancement," and thereby
                  allow contributors to prioritize issues/bugs reported to the project.
                  See [Atom's
                  example section](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#suggesting-enhancements).

11.  **Style Guide / Coding conventions** -
                  [See Atom's example](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#styleguides).

12.  **Code of Conduct** - You can make this part of CONTRIBUTING.md as
                  [Atom did](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-of-conduct) to
                  set the tone for contributions.  You can also make this a separate Markdown file
                  and link to it in CONTRIBUTING.md.  You can also extend this section to link to your
                  LICENSE.md or any details for project consumers on permissions and license details you
                  have established for building on your work.

13.  **Recognition model** - provide a pre-emptive "thank you" for
                  contributing and list any recognition contributors might receive for
                  participating in your project.

14.  **Who is involved?** - [Open Government's CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/opengovernment/opengovernment/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
                  has as a name/author, and it might be nice to have a more personal/friendly individual
                  to attact to a project and reach out to with questions. You might list the core
                  contributors and their preferred methods of contact here, or link to a
                  [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/) file in your root directory (same
                  place as your CONTRIBUTING.md file), which lets people know who they are working. Here
                  is an [example of a humans.txt file](http://www.stereosemantics.com/humans.txt).

15.  **Where can I ask for help?** - a nice extension to the previous section,
                  with links to good comms channels for anyone with questions.
