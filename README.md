## Project Motivation

When doing a Google search for '[game design](http://google.com/#q=game+design)' as of January 2020, the results skew heavily toward accredited degrees and expensive training programs.
Very few of the results are for helping people actually learn how to design games.
Game design is a very experimental and interative process - something you need to practice at for a long time to get a feel for.

Good resources for learning game design *do* exist, but they're scattered across personal blogs, reddit, GDC talks, YouTube videos, books and many other places.
There currently does not exist a singlular place for high quality resources that is also accessible for aspiring and professional game designers.

We here at *ASGD* feel that game design is a field as important to the future development of the world as
