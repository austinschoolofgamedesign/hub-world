# Welcome to *Austin School of Game Design*

Here you'll find high quality game design resources - for both video games and board/tabletop games - written and shared under the open source Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA 4.0).
In-depth stuff like:

- Game analysis and breakdowns
- Game design theory
- Game design mechanisms
- Game design exercises and courses
- Studies, articles, videos, talks
- Textbooks, scholarly papers
- Lists of external resources like recommended books, conventions, programs, etc.
- And whatever else ends up being relevant

## Project Motivation

When doing a Google search for '[game design](http://google.com/#q=game+design)' as of January 2020, the results skew heavily toward accredited degrees and expensive training programs.
Very few of the results are for helping people actually learn how to design games.
Game design is a very experimental and interative process - something you need to practice at for a long time to get a feel for.

Good resources for learning game design *do* exist, but they're scattered across personal blogs, reddit, GDC talks, YouTube videos, books and many other places.
There currently does not exist a singlular place for high quality resources that is also accessible for aspiring and professional game designers.

We here at *ASGD* feel that game design is an important field of study for the future development of the world.
The principled learned from studying games and play has far reaching implications in education, politics, cultural dynamics, social structures, and motivativion (to name a few).
Part of that is, of course, the cultural misunderstanding around the importance of play and its inherent value.
But it's also that we, as proponents of game design, are also not very good at documenting and sharing the insight we've made.

Our hope is that *Austin Shool of Game Design* can be a catalyst in making that change.

## Project Vision

While the process outlined below will most certainly be more organic than the documentation makes it feel, there are a few milestones - or phases - that will indicate when we've reached some critical mass.

### Phase 1

In the beginning, the focus of *ASGD* is to collect and organize a large body of high quality game design resources.

### Phase 2

When there's enough traction and mass within the open sourced documentation, we will begin sponsoring and organizing community events around fleshing out the portions of our internal resources that aren't up to snuff.

### Phase 3

<!-- todo  -->

## Contribute <!-- TODO -->

*ASGD* is built by a group of passionate game design nerds that want to make game design more accessible.
